<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is William Cuttrell - I am a second semester transfer student from Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I am studying Computer Information Systems: I chose this field because I love math and science, and I believe computers and computer systems will play an essential role in the advancement of technology now and for many years to come.
